# Task

A system that detects human laughter and awards a reward QR code based on continuous laughter. Using AI techniques like facial detection and emotion recognition to identify and track human faces, specifically focusing on the facial expressions associated with laughter. Integrated models with the camera feed to detect and track laughing faces in real-time. Regarding the audio processing aspect, we will be utilizing speech and audio recognition techniques to capture and analyze audio input from the microphone. AI algorithms will be implemented that can identify and distinguish laughter sounds from other types of audio signals. Once the system detects continuous laughter, it will fills a progress bar on the screen. Once the maximum grade or progress level is reached, the system will generate a unique reward QR code for the user on the screen which will be used as reward.

Key Features

- Real-time detection of laughing faces and sounds
- Continuous monitoring of laughter duration
- Grading system to track and reward continuous laughter
- Dynamic progress bar on the screen to visualize laughter level



# Facial Detection and Emotion Recognition
This project is a facial detection and emotion recognition system written in Python. It uses OpenCV and Dlib libraries to detect faces and classify emotions.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine using the command git clone git@github.com:alanahmet/laughter-detection.git.
- Install the required dependencies by running the command pip install -r requirements.txt.
- Run the script facial_detection.py to start the facial detection and emotion recognition system.

# Usage
To use this system, run the script facial_detection.py with the --source argument to specify the source video path. For webcam --source 0.
